CmIconPicker

How it works :

It captures com.cyanogenmod.ACTION_PICK_ICON and shows the list of icons
Upon choosing one, it appends
"image_normal" and "image_activated" as extra's to the return intent.
Those 2 extra's are bitmaps of the appropriate drawable states.

How to add new images :

Images must be of format ic_*_normal.png and have a corresponding
ic_*_activated.png

Just drop a pair into the drawable folders and thats it.
