CmIconPicker

How it works :

It captures com.cyanogenmod.ACTION_PICK_ICON and shows the list of icons

Upon choosing one, it returns an intent with the following extras :
"resource_name" - Name of the drawable resource
"package_name" - Name of the package holding the resource

How to add new images :

Images must be of format ic_*_normal.png and have a corresponding ic_*_activated.png

Just drop a pair into the drawable folders and thats it.
